# Build and install the latest ForestClaw develop branch including p4est,
# libsc, zlib and jansson.  We first download and install a recent zlib to
# a local directory, then do the same for the jansson library.  Then we
# clone and install the current develop branches of p4est and libsc using
# that zlib and jansson installation and finally clone and install the
# current develop branch of ForestClaw, linking against all of the above.

# This results in five installation directories that any higher
# level software package may be compiled and linked against.
# The options are similar to those used in this script.
# In particular, the -rpath option may turn out useful.

# let the p4est installation script set the stage
